"SAFEYOU+: Strengthens the anti-doping fight in youth amateur and fitness sports", is an Erasmus+ Collaborative Partnership, which utilizes state-of-the-art scientific knowledge and methods, in order to understand doping cases in sports, develop an educational tool that provides updated information and resources about abstaining from doping, as well as educating stakeholders and end-users about the harms of doping and how to abstain. More details can be found on the <a href="http://safeyou.eu/">project’s webpage</a>.

"TWEETSAFE" is a project developed by OSWINDS Research Group as part of this collaborative partnership (A23, A24, in WP4: Crowdsourced content retrieval and modelling). The goal of this project is to crowdsource social media on the topic of doping in order to enable more anti-doping policies, to expand its impact by involving a wider and more diverse group of sports professionals and stakeholder, also to disseminate anti-doping education in wider target groups and finally to utilize innovative technologies and pedagogical approaches. “TWEETSAFE” performs social media mining regarding doping cases and related people on Twitter, Youtube and Google+, as well as data analytics and sentiment analysis techniques on the collected data, while it also enables the visualization of the results through an online platform.
